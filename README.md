## ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan Pate
- I'm a Full-Stack software engineer with personal interests ranging from mobile development, to Web3, to biotech and longevity. I spend much of my free time
  developing various software projects including several mobile apps. I'm currently focused on bringing NFTs to the culturally significant industry of internet memes
  by creating a standardized method of minting meme NFTs with guarenteed scarcity and value. 
- I enjoy leveraging my technical knowledge to invest in public technology companies as well as private companies through equity crowdfunding. Maybe someday I'll raise
  a VC fund. 
- On this profile, you'll find some of my random projects many of which are incomplete and/or in development. I've developed several full stack mobile apps 
  currently on the iOS app store which you can learn more about on my website. Currently, I'm a full-stack developer at https://www.startplaying.games. I have also
  worked at McAfee (intern, enterprise web software developer) and Daimler Trucks North America (intern, infrastructure as code).
